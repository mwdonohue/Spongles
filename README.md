# Spongles
Spongles is the third iteration of the same Discord bot I have been making for five years.
Needless to say I have not implemented any new features with the bot in this time.

In 2015, the original Discord bot was a heaping pile of trash that just shut down whenever it felt like it.
It was written in Python, but I don't remember understanding a single line of code that I wrote, so I just disregard its existence and move on.

Enter 2019. I was nearing the end of NC State's CSC 116 class in the Spring, my first official formal brush with programming. I found the class to be very enjoyable and decided
that it would be an excellent idea to remake the bot I made in 2015. Looking back, this version wasn't too bad. The big issue with it was that I had absolutely
no clue about the Java Collections Framework and ended up implementing a crude ArrayList from scratch, which was pretty fun. Sadly this bot, named "Dreams," was
deleted when I destroyed the Digitalocean server in which it lived.

So here we are today. I decided that I would relearn Python by creating this same bot for the 3rd time. His name is Spongles and I believe he has a great future.
With this in mind, I have no idea what his future will be and neither does he, but I do know that it is great.
